Industry Growth Analysis with BERT Fine-Tune Model by Aniket Artani

Welcome to the Industry Growth Analysis code documentation! This code aims to help users analyze the growth percentages of various industries. Using a fine-tuned BERT model, the code allows users to find the industry with the highest or lowest growth on a given day or retrieve the growth percentage of a specific industry.

Problem Statement
The problem addressed by this code is to enable users to access and analyze industry growth data easily. Users should be able to perform the following tasks:

Find the industry with the highest growth percentage on a given time.
Find the industry with the lowest growth percentage on a given day.
Retrieve the growth percentage of a particular industry on a given day.

Solution Overview
To solve the problem, we employed a BERT fine-tuned model, which is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model. We use this model to extract relevant information about industry growth from various sources. The key libraries used in this solution are:

Transformers: A powerful library by Hugging Face that provides pre-trained NLP models, including BERT.
Pandas: A versatile library for data manipulation and analysis.
Beautiful Soup: A library for extracting data from HTML and XML files.

Dependencies
Before running the code, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
transformers (Hugging Face)
pandas
beautifulsoup4
